## Features
### Managing the new and deleted chats

* **New chat** </br>
Everytime we click on generate new step, if a new message is arrived from a <b>chat/contact</b> which was not already present. It moves the message to the top and shifting the rest downwards.


* **Delete message** </br>
If the operation on generate new step is delete, it deletes the message and moves the chats below the deleted message upwards.

## Idea
The idea for this project came from the working of various chat applicaions like Whatsapp, hike, Instagram etc. 


## Future Scope
* To add message selection and display option.
* Dynamic messages instead of the static ones.
* Improving the Design.
